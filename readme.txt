WELCOME TO FRUIT NINJA

This game is based off of Halfbrick Studios' original game, Fruit Ninja

Desciption: 
Fruits(in this game circles) and bombs are thrown randomly on the screen and the difficulty 
increases as the game progresses. The main objective of this game is to 
slice the maximum amount of fruits on the computer screen by dragging the 
mouse across the entire body of the fruit and avoiding any contact with bombs.
There are 3 modes of gameplay: Classic Mode, Arcade Mode, or Zen Mode.
Each mode has 4 different levels and the difficulty increases based on the current level.
The goal in the classic mode is to hit all of the fruits on the screen 
and the game is over when either a bomb is hit or 3 fruits are unable to be 
sliced by the user. The arcade mode has a timer of 15 seconds and score increases
by 10 when a fruit is sliced. When a bomb is hit, the score decreases by 10. 
The zen mode is similar to the arcade mode, but it also includes special fruits 
that can increase the score even more. If a bomb is hit in the zen mode, 
the screen will clear of all fruits or bombs. The user also has the ability
to save their data and reload it when they choose to play again.
